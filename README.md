#### Implementation of an sPWM signal on Ardunio and Atmel micros

## Introduction

This document covers key concepts in the generation of a sinusoidal signal using dynamic
pulse width modulation (PWM) as well as it’s implementation on Atmel microcontrollers,
including Arduino boards. The code in this document is mostly C with use of Arduino
code/libraries in some cases. This document assumes the reader has a fundamental under-
standing of C programming.
It is the aim of this document to help the hobbyist or student make rapid progress
in understanding and implementing an sPWM signal. If you find any mistakes in this
document or can think of improvements, perhaps you are a university tutor or lecturer,
make a suggestion in the associated forum. Any significant contributors will be listed as an

## Key PWM Concepts
###Basic PWM

Pulse width modulation’s (PWM) main use is to control the power supplied to electric
circuits, it does this by rapidly switching a load on and off. Another way of thinking of it
is to consider it as a method for a digital system to output an analogue signal. The figure below shows an example of a PWM signal.

![Figure 1-1](https://github.com/Terbytes/Arduino-Atmel-sPWM/blob/master/im/basicPWM_3.png?raw=true "Figure 1.1")

There are two properties to a PWM signal, the frequency which is determined by the period of the signal and the duty cycle which is determined by the high-time of the signal. The signal in Figure 1.1 has a period of 250μS which means it switches at 4KHz. The duty- cycle is the percent high time in each period, in the last figure the duty-cycle is 60% because of the high-time and period of 150μS and 250μS respectively. It is the duty-cycle that determines average output voltage. In Figure 1.1 the duty-cycle of 60% with 5V switching voltage results in 3V average output as shown by the red line. After filtering the output a stable analogue output can be achieved. Figure 1.2 shows PWM signals with 80% and 10% duty-cycles. By dynamically changing the duty-cycle, signals other than a flat output voltage can be achieved.

### Typical micro-controller PWM implementation

This section describes how micro-controllers use timers/counters to implement a PWM signal, this description relies heavily on Figure 1.3. Here the blue line represents a counter that resets after 16000, this gives the period of the PWM and also the switching frequency (f s ), if this micro had a clock source of 16MHz, then f s would be 16×10^6/16×10^3 = 1KHz. There are two other values represented by the green and red lines, which determine the duty-cycle. The values shown are 11200 and 8000 and these give the high time of the PWM signal, and the duty-cycle is these values as a fraction of the PWM period. Therefore the red PWM has a duty-cycle of 11200/16000 = 70% and the red PWM has a duty-cycle of 8000/16000 = 50%

### Sinusoidal PWM

A sinusoidal PWM (sPWM) signal can be constructed by dynamically changing the duty-
cycle. The result is short pulses at the zero-crossings and long pulses at the wave peaks.
This can be seen in Figure 1.1

![Figure what](https://github.com/Terbytes/Arduino-Atmel-sPWM/blob/master/im/PWMsin_2.png?raw=true "Figure")

Figure 1.4 shows negative pulses which is not possible on most micro-controllers.
Instead normally this is implemented with two pins, one pulsing the positive half of the sin
wave and the second pulsing the negative half, this is how it is implemented in this paper.

## Code & Implementation

In this chapter three examples of code are given, each adding more advanced functionality
to the code. Even though this code was written with Arduino in mind the code is written
in pure C, however in Chapter an example of modified code that is more Arduino friendly
is given. If the signal is going to be viewed on an oscilloscope we suggest to modify the
code to toggle a pin every interrupt service routine (ISR) to be used as a trigger.

### Manually entered look up table sPWM code

The following C code implements an sPWM on a Atmel micro-controller. The signal
is generated on two pins, one responsible for the positive half of the sine wave and the other
pin the negative half. The sPWM is generated by running an (ISR) every period of the
PWM in order to dynamically change the duty-cycle. This is done by changing the values
in the registers OCR1A and OCR1B from values in a look up table. There are two look up
tables for each of the two pins, lookUpTable1 and lookUpTable2 and both have 200 values.
The first half of lookUpTable1 has sin values from 0 to π and the second half is all zeroes.
The first half of lookUpTable2 is all zeroes and the second half has sin values from 0 to π
as shown in Figure 2.1.

The code assumes implementation on a ATmega328 or Arduino Uno with a 16MHz
clock source. This means the output pins will be PORTB1 and PORTB2 which are pins 9
and 10 on the Uno. The code is compatible with other Atmel micro-controllers/Arduinos
though their data-sheets/schematics will need to be referenced to determine the output
pins. Please see Chapter for a list of compatible devices.
