#### Implementation of an sPWM signal on Ardunio and Atmel micros

## Introduction

This document covers key concepts in the generation of a sinusoidal signal using dynamic
pulse width modulation (PWM) as well as itâ€™s implementation on Atmel microcontrollers,
including Arduino boards. The code in this document is mostly C with use of Arduino
code/libraries in some cases. This document assumes the reader has a fundamental under-
standing of C programming.
It is the aim of this document to help the hobbyist or student make rapid progress
in understanding and implementing an sPWM signal. If you find any mistakes in this
document or can think of improvements, perhaps you are a university tutor or lecturer,
make a suggestion in the associated forum. Any significant contributors will be listed as an
