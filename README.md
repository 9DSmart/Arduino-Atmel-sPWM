## Brief Theory
###Basic PWM

Pulse width modulation’s (PWM) main use is to control the voltage supplied to electric circuits, it does this by rapidly switching a load on and off. Another way of thinking of it is to consider it as a method for a digital system to output an analogue signal. The figure below shows an example of a PWM signal.

![Figure 1-1](https://github.com/Terbytes/Arduino-Atmel-sPWM/blob/master/im/basicPWM_3.png?raw=true "Figure 1.1")

There are two properties to a PWM signal, the frequency which is determined by the period of the signal and the duty cycle which is determined by the high-time of the signal. The signal in Figure 1.1 has a period of 250μS which means it switches at 4KHz. The duty- cycle is the percent high time in each period, in the last figure the duty-cycle is 60% because of the high-time and period of 150μS and 250μS respectively. It is the duty-cycle that determines average output voltage. In Figure 1.1 the duty-cycle of 60% with 5V switching voltage results in 3V average output as shown by the red line. After filtering the output a stable analogue output can be achieved. Figure 1.2 shows PWM signals with 80% and 10% duty-cycles. By dynamically changing the duty-cycle, signals other than a flat output voltage can be achieved.

### Typical micro-controller PWM implementation

This section describes how micro-controllers use timers/counters to implement a PWM signal, this description relies heavily on Figure 1.3. Here the blue line represents a counter that resets after 16000, this gives the period of the PWM and also the switching frequency (f s ), if this micro had a clock source of 16MHz, then f s would be 16×10^6/16×10^3 = 1KHz. There are two other values represented by the green and red lines, which determine the duty-cycle. The values shown are 11200 and 8000 and these give the high time of the PWM signal, and the duty-cycle is these values as a fraction of the PWM period. Therefore the red PWM has a duty-cycle of 11200/16000 = 70% and the red PWM has a duty-cycle of 8000/16000 = 50%

### Sinusoidal PWM

A sinusoidal PWM (sPWM) signal can be constructed by dynamically changing the duty- cycle. The result is short pulses at the zero-crossings and long pulses at the wave peaks. This can be seen in Figure 1.1

![Figure what](https://github.com/Terbytes/Arduino-Atmel-sPWM/blob/master/im/PWMsin_2.png?raw=true "Figure")

Figure 1.4 shows negative pulses which is not possible on most micro-controllers. Instead normally this is implemented with two pins, one pulsing the positive half of the sin wave and the second pulsing the negative half, this is how it is implemented in this paper.

## Code and Explanation

In this chapter three examples of code are given, each adding more advanced functionality to the code. Even though this code was written with Arduino in mind the code is written in pure C, however in Chapter an example of modified code that is more Arduino friendly is given. If the signal is going to be viewed on an oscilloscope we suggest to modify the code to toggle a pin every interrupt service routine (ISR) to be used as a trigger.

### Manually entered look up table sPWM code

The following C code implements an sPWM on a Atmel micro-controller. The signal is generated on two pins, one responsible for the positive half of the sine wave and the other pin the negative half. The sPWM is generated by running an (ISR) every period of the PWM in order to dynamically change the duty-cycle. This is done by changing the values in the registers OCR1A and OCR1B from values in a look up table. There are two look up tables for each of the two pins, lookUpTable1 and lookUpTable2 and both have 200 values. The first half of lookUpTable1 has sin values from 0 to π and the second half is all zeroes. The first half of lookUpTable2 is all zeroes and the second half has sin values from 0 to π as shown in Figure 2.1.

![Figure what](https://github.com/Terbytes/Arduino-Atmel-sPWM/blob/master/im/lookup_2.png?raw=true "Figure")

The code assumes implementation on a ATmega328 or Arduino Uno with a 16MHz clock source. This means the output pins will be PORTB1 and PORTB2 which are pins 9 and 10 on the Uno. The code is compatible with other Atmel micro-controllers/Arduinos though their data-sheets/schematics will need to be referenced to determine the output pins. Please see Chapter for a list of compatible devices.

Lets walk through the code.

```c
#include <avr/io.h>
#include <avr/interrupt.h>

// Look up tables with 200 entries each, normalised to have max value of 1600 which is the period of the PWM loaded into register ICR1.
int lookUp1[] = {50 ,100 ,151 ,201 ,250 ,300 ,349 ,398 ,446 ,494 ,542 ,589 ,635 ,681 ,726 ,771 ,814 ,857 ,899 ,940 ,981 ,1020 ,1058 ,1095 ,1131 ,1166 ,1200 ,1233 ,1264 ,1294 ,1323 ,1351 ,1377 ,1402 ,1426 ,1448 ,1468 ,1488 ,1505 ,1522 ,1536 ,1550 ,1561 ,1572 ,1580 ,1587 ,1593 ,1597 ,1599 ,1600 ,1599 ,1597 ,1593 ,1587 ,1580 ,1572 ,1561 ,1550 ,1536 ,1522 ,1505 ,1488 ,1468 ,1448 ,1426 ,1402 ,1377 ,1351 ,1323 ,1294 ,1264 ,1233 ,1200 ,1166 ,1131 ,1095 ,1058 ,1020 ,981 ,940 ,899 ,857 ,814 ,771 ,726 ,681 ,635 ,589 ,542 ,494 ,446 ,398 ,349 ,300 ,250 ,201 ,151 ,100 ,50 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0 ,0};

```

We are going to be adressing the registeres on the atmel chip as well as using interrupts so the <avr/io.h> and <avr/interrupt.h> headers are nessisary. From there we have two arrays which have a two half sinusoidal signal entered in

```c
void setup(){
    // Register initilisation, see datasheet for more detail.
    TCCR1A = 0b10100010;
       /*10 clear on match, set at BOTTOM for compA.
         10 clear on match, set at BOTTOM for compB.
         00
         10 WGM1 1:0 for waveform 15.
       */
    TCCR1B = 0b00011001;
       /*000
         11 WGM1 3:2 for waveform 15.
         001 no prescale on the counter.
       */
    TIMSK1 = 0b00000001;
       /*0000000
         1 TOV1 Flag interrupt enable. 
       */
```
Here the timer registered have been initilised. If you ar interested in the deatails you can look up the 328p data sheet, but for now what's important is that we have set up a PWM for two pins and it call in interrupt routine for every period of the PWM.

```c
    ICR1   = 1600;     // Period for 16MHz crystal, for a switching frequency of 100KHz for 200 subdevisions per 50Hz sin wave cycle.
    sei();             // Enable global interrupts.
    DDRB = 0b00000110; // Set PB1 and PB2 as outputs.
    pinMode(13,OUTPUT);
}
```
ICR1 is another register that contains the length of the counter before resetting, since we have no prescale on our clock, this defines the period of the PWM to 1600 clock cycles. Then we enable interrupts. Next the two pins are set as outputs, the reason why pinMode() is not used is because the pins might change on different arduinos, they might also change on different Atmel micros, however you are using an arduino with a 328p, then this code will work. Lastly pinMode() is used to set pin 13 as an out put, we will use this later as a trigger for the osilliscope, how ever it is not nessisary.

```c
void loop(){; /*Do nothing . . . . forever!*/}
```
Nothing is implemented in the loop.

```c
ISR(TIMER1_OVF_vect){
    static int num;
    static char trig;
    // change duty-cycle every period.
    OCR1A = lookUp1[num];
    OCR1B = lookUp2[num];
    
    if(++num >= 200){ // Pre-increment num then check it's below 200.
       num = 0;       // Reset num.
       trig = trig^0b00000001;
       digitalWrite(13,trig);
     }
}
```
This interrupt service routine is call every period of the PWM, and every period the duty-cycle is change. This done by changing the value in the registers OCR1A and OCR1B to the next value of the look up table as this registers hold the compare values that set the output pins low when reached as per figure .

Therefore each period the registeres OCR1x are loaded with the next value of their look up tables by using num to point to the next value in the array, as each period num is incremented and checked that it is below 200, if it is not below 200 in is reset to 0. The other two lines involving trig and digitalWrite are there two toggle a pin as a trigger for an osilloscope and does not impact the sPWM code.

And that's it. The rest of this section discusses some modifications to this code, namely we can make generate the lookup table at the start of the code, the benifits of this is we change change the switchinf frequency as well as the sPWM frequency. Code for this can be found in the sPWM_generate_lookup_table folder. The start of the code looks like this:

```c
#include <avr/io.h>
#include <avr/interrupt.h>

#define SinDivisions (200)// Sub divisions of sisusoidal wave.

static int microMHz = 16; // Micro clock frequency
static int freq = 50;     // Sinusoidal frequency
static long int period;   // Period of PWM in clock cycles.
static unsigned int lookUp[SinDivisions];
static char theTCCR1A = 0b10000010; //varible for TCCR1A

void setup(){
  double temp; //Double varible for <math.h> functions.
  
  period = microMHz*1e6/freq/SinDivisions;// Period of PWM in clock cycles
  
  for(int i = 0; i < SinDivisions/2; i++){ // Generating the look up table.
    temp = sin(i*2*M_PI/SinDivisions)*period;
    lookUp[i] = (int)(temp+0.5);       // Round to integer.    
  }
```
Notice that only the first half of the sine wave is generated, because of the way this code implements the sPMW where each of the two pins are responisble for different halves of the signal, only half the sine wave is needed. However it does require a modification to the interrupt service routine.

```c
ISR(TIMER1_OVF_vect){
    static int num;
    static int delay1;
    static char trig;
    
    if(delay1 == 1){/*delay by one period because the high time loaded into OCR1A:B values are buffered but can be disconnected immediately by TCCR1A. */
      theTCCR1A ^= 0b10100000;// Toggle connect and disconnect of compare output A and B.
      TCCR1A = theTCCR1A;
      delay1 = 0;             // Reset delay1
    } else if(num >= SinDivisions/2){
      num = 0;                // Reset num
      delay1++;
      trig ^=0b00000001;
      digitalWrite(13,trig);
    }
    // change duty-cycle every period.
    OCR1A = lookUp[num];
    OCR1B = lookUp[num];
    num++;
}
``` 
Both output compare registers ORC1x have the same values loaded into them each period, however the output compare for each pin is enabled and disable in turns by toggling two bits in the TCCR1A resgister. It is toggle each time the look up table index (num) is reset, however it is delayed by one clock cycle, this is because when values are loaded into OCR1x registered, is is buffered where as changes in TCCR1A is implemented imediately, see the 328p datasheet for more details.

## Testing the Signal

This chapter discusses ways to test and monitor the sPWM signal, the first section discusses using as oscilloscope which is the best method to verify the signal however an alternate and cheaper method is to use a small speaker. The 50hz signal and the underlying switching frequency is easy to hear.

### Viewing Pulse Widths with an osilloscope

Here we aim to view the individual pulses that make up the sPWM to see if they look how we would expect, that is thin pulses becoming thick and then thin again. Assuming the reader is using the code of Listing ??, there are a few modifications recommended. We recommend lowering the switching frequency of the sPWM by changing ’ #define SinDivisions ... (200) ’ to ’ #define SinDivisions (50) ’. This will make the pulses easier to see as there will be fewer of them. We also recommend toggling a pin every time the look up table resets. If you are using the Uno, this can be done by changing ’ DDRB = 0b00000110; ’ to ’ DDRB = 0b00100110; ’ and to place ’ PORTB ˆ= 0b00100000; ’ inside the ’ else ... if(num >= SinDivisions/2) ’ statement. This will toggle PortB pin2 which is the led pin on the Uno (pin13). Now this pin can be used as a trigger with the oscilloscope. Figure 4.1 shows the wiring to the Ardurino Uno.

![Figure what](https://github.com/Terbytes/Arduino-Atmel-sPWM/blob/master/im/PulseOscill_1.png?raw=true "Figure")

The wave form produced should look like Figure 4.2a which is similar to have the wave form from Figure 1.4. Figures 4.2b and 4.2c show the pulse widths at their narrowest and thickest.

### Viewing the filtered signal with an oscilloscope

![Figure what](https://github.com/Terbytes/Arduino-Atmel-sPWM/blob/master/im/filterOscill_2.png?raw=true "Figure")

Here we aim to view a smooth sinusoidal wave by smoothing the output of the micro with a simple low-pass RC filter as shown in Figure 4.3. 
The purpose of the filter is to remove the much higher switching frequency (f s ) and leave only the 50Hz sin wave. The cut-off frequency (f c ) of the filter determined by f c = 1 2πRC should lie somewhere between f s and 50Hz, closer to 50Hz is more optimal. f s is determined by the line of code ’ #define SinDivisions (a number) ’ in Listings 2.2, 2.3 and 3. The switching frequency is given by f s = a number ×50Hz, replacing a number with any arbitrary number may produce unexpected results, we recommend using 50,200 and 400 to produced f s ’s of 2.5,10 and 20 KHz respectively.

![Figure what](https://github.com/Terbytes/Arduino-Atmel-sPWM/blob/master/im/smoothed_2.png?raw=true "Figure")

Alternatively a potentiometer can be used as a variable resistor as shown in Fig-
ure 4.5a. This allows the f c to be varied. Figure 4.5b to 4.5f shows the same signal with
progressively lower f c

### Listening to the Signal

If you don’t have an oscilloscope, listening to the signal is a useful way to determine if the sPWM is working since it is easy to hear both the 50Hz hum and the switching frequency. We can use the micro to drive a small pair of head-phones directly, putting them in series with a 1KΩ resister should protect most head-phones, as seen in Figure 4.6.

![Figure what](https://github.com/Terbytes/Arduino-Atmel-sPWM/blob/master/im/speaker_2.png?raw=true "Figure")

It is recommended to change ’ #define SinDivisions (200) ’ down to 50 and up to 400 in order to hear the difference in switching frequencies.

## Safety

This section is to briefly discuss safety in regards to making an inverter that steps up to  mains voltage whether that be 110 or 230. First of all I don't encourage it, I'd prefer that you didn't and I take no responsibilty for your actions. Remember 30mA can be leathal, mains voltage deserves respect.

If you still choose to do so, take basic precautionary steps like: Invest in some terminals and make sure that any high voltage part of the circuit is not touchable; don't modify it while it's power up; Don't do it alone.
